  I am Evelyn Rivera, 61 years old. On December 23, 2009 I was diagnosed with liver cancer and cirrhosis brought on by Hep C. January 2010 found me at UCHospital, Denver undergoing an evaluation for a liver transplant. Once I was placed on the list I began chemo treatments for the cancer and interferon treatment for the Hep C. July 26, 2011 I received my first transplant. That liver developed bile duct issues and my health declined. After much misery and a second interferon treatment I received my second transplant on February 25, 2015. I am alive again! Forever grateful to those who chose to be organ donors, I am now dedicated to increasing the number of donors so that others may have a shorter wait for a new life.
