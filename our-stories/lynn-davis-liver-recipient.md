  In the spring of 2014, I suddenly began feeling ill, had a decrease of energy,
  and wanted to sleep all the time. Within 6 weeks, the situation was far worse.
  I could barely drive, my cognitive abilities were affected, and I no longer
  had the energy to do the things I loved doing or even get out of bed. My
  doctor ran lab tests and found that my liver enzymes were extremely elevated.




  Two weeks later, I was hospitalized. A CT scan and Biopsy showed I was in
  acute (sudden & severe onset) liver failure. I was told that I only had 5%
  liver function and I that I needed to find a liver clinic. Two days later, I
  was at Mayo Clinic in Phoenix being evaluated for a liver transplant. Within a
  few days, I was diagnosed with Fulminant Hepatic Toxicity and admitted to Mayo
  Hospital. I was in disbelief and was sure there had been a horrible mistake.
  After all, I was young (52) healthy and active.


  The liver is an amazing organ that has the ability to repair itself. The
  doctors at Mayo began treatment in the attempt to repair my failing liver.
  Unfortunately, my liver was too damaged and treatment was unsuccessful. The
  only alternative remaining was a new liver and without one, I would die in a
  very short time. I was placed on the “wait list,” joining over 120,000 other
  people in the U.S. who were also waiting for a lifesaving organ transplant.
  Approximately 15,000 were in need of a liver.


  Over the next few days, my condition deteriorated. They moved me in to ICU and
  changed my status on the organ transplant wait list to “status 1A.” This
  status is reserved for patients with acute liver failure and a life expectancy
  of hours to a few days without a transplant. The survival rate for individuals
  with acute liver failure is less than 20% due to the sudden and rapid
  deterioration of the liver. The following morning on June 24, 2014 I received
  the news that a matching liver had become available and that evening I
  underwent a successful liver transplant.


  On the second year anniversary of my liver transplant, I had the amazing
  experience of meeting my donor’s mother. My donor was a 20 year old incredible
  young man that was in college to become a doctor. His aspiration was to help
  others and save lives and he did, just that! I think of my donor every day and
  am forever grateful for his decision to become a registered organ donor. If
  you are not already a registered organ donor, please consider becoming one. If
  you are a registered donor, thank you!
