  It is now time for me to move on\
  Into the dusk, but also the dawn.\
  \
  I will remain as the morning comes\
  As I've left behind a gift for someone.\
  \
  So another may walk,\
  may talk, may see\
  \
  Where their life was locked,\
  I offered a key.\
  \
  I am a donor to someone in need,\
  My final gift, my final deed.\
