          <ContentHeader>OTAP History</ContentHeader>
          <p>
            In 1990, upon the advice of an Albuquerque transplant surgeon, a
            group of heart and lung recipients formed their own support group.
            Then kidney recipients joined the group. After that liver recipients
            and pancreas/kidney recipients joined. When the United Network for
            Organ Sharing regionalized the transplant centers and closed down
            Albuquerqueâ€™s heart, lung &amp; liver programs, the group continued
            to meet.
          </p>

            <strong>Nov 15, 1993</strong> the original members incorporated as
            Transplant Recipients International of New Mexico.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>April 2002</strong> the local group discontinued affiliation
            with TRIO and reorganized as Organ Transplant Recipients of New
            Mexico, Inc.
          </p>
          <p>
